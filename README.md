Rapidly build pipelines for out-of-core data processing using higher order functions.

`chevrons` is a collection of tools for building memory-efficient pipelines on iterators by composing functions. It introduces a clean syntax for passing data between functions which are composed.

More documentation to come! This is still a very new project.

Please note that at the moment, `chevrons` only supports Python 3 and later.
